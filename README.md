## Why this Project
This Integration is used for HomeAssistant to provide smart function and is related to my [thermotec aeroflow python library project](https://github.com/KaiGrassnick/py-thermotec-aeroflow-flexismart). 


## How to install

1. Download the latest release
2. Extract and Upload the folder as `thermotec_aeroflow` into your `<config_folder>/custom_components`
   - Make sure the Folder is actually called: `thermotec_aeroflow`. The Name needs to match the Domain.
   - E.g.: If the folder is called: `thermotec_aeroflow-0.0.5` you will not be able to activate the Integration with an Error like this: `{"message":"Invalid handler specified"}`
4. Restart HASSIO
5. Go to integrations
6. Force reload cache ( STRG + F5 or delete Cache )
7. Add new Integration, search for __Thermotec Aeroflow__


## FAQ
- Error: `{"message":"Invalid handler specified"}`
  - Verify the folder you uploaded to `custom_components` is called `thermotec_aeroflow`.
  - It will not work if the folder is called differently. Example: `thermotec_aeroflow-0.0.5` will throw this error

## How to use
Heaters / Zone are detected automatically (if e.g. created via the app)
